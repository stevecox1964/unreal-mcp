**Fork of [chongdashu/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp)**

</div>

> This is a fork of [chongdashu/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp). Original work by [@chongdashu](https://www.x.com/chongdashu). This fork extends the base project with additional features — see [Changes from Upstream](#changes-from-upstream) below.

This project enables AI assistant clients like Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop to control Unreal Engine through natural language using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## ⚠️ Experimental Status

This project is currently in an **EXPERIMENTAL** state. The API, functionality, and implementation details are subject to significant changes. While we encourage testing and feedback, please be aware that:

- Breaking changes may occur without notice
- Features may be incomplete or unstable
- Documentation may be outdated or missing
- Production use is not recommended at this time

## 🌟 Overview

The Unreal MCP integration provides comprehensive tools for controlling Unreal Engine through natural language:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Actor Management** | • Create and delete actors (cubes, spheres, lights, cameras, etc.)<br>• Set actor transforms (position, rotation, scale)<br>• Query actor properties and find actors by name<br>• List all actors in the current level |
| **Blueprint Development** | • Create new Blueprint classes with custom components<br>• Add and configure components (mesh, camera, light, etc.)<br>• Set component properties and physics settings<br>• Compile Blueprints and spawn Blueprint actors<br>• Create input mappings for player controls |
| **Blueprint Node Graph** | • Add event nodes (BeginPlay, Tick, etc.)<br>• Create function call nodes and connect them<br>• Add variables with custom types and default values<br>• Create component and self references<br>• Find and manage nodes in the graph |
| **Editor Control** | • Focus viewport on specific actors or locations<br>• Control viewport camera orientation and distance |
| **Character Interaction** | • Send and receive messages to/from NPC characters<br>• Query character status, health, inventory, location, and current action<br>• Command characters to move, follow, stop, look at targets<br>• Pick up and drop items (socket attachment)<br>• Set AI state, play animations, trigger dialogue<br>• Per-character key-value memory store<br>• Scan for nearby actors within a radius |
| **Camera Capture** | • Trigger a `CameraCaptureActor` to take a scene snapshot during PIE<br>• Images saved as `<ActorName>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>.png` in the project folder<br>• Auto-discovers the first camera in the level if no name is specified<br>• AI assistants can read the image and analyze the scene |

All these capabilities are accessible through natural language commands via AI assistants, making it easy to automate and control Unreal Engine workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Startup Sequence

Every session, start things in this order:

1. **Run the Unreal project** — open and play the project in the editor. This starts the C++ TCP server (port 55557) that the Python server connects to.
2. **Run Claude Code** — launching Claude Code starts the Python MCP server (`unreal_mcp_server.py`) via the `.mcp.json` config, which then connects to Unreal.

> If Claude Code is started before Unreal, the Python server will fail to connect. Always start Unreal first.

### Restarting the MCP server without rebooting

The MCP server runs over stdio, so the MCP client owns the live child process. If the transport gets stale, use the repo-root helper:

```powershell
.\restart_unreal_mcp_server.bat
```

Then reload or reconnect the `unrealMCP` server in your MCP client. This stops only this repo's `unreal_mcp_server.py` processes; it does not restart Unreal or Windows.

For LLM key/model changes, a process restart should not be needed after the latest changes. The simulation layer reloads `Python/.env` before LLM decisions, and the MCP tool `reload_llm_environment()` can be used to reload and inspect masked LLM settings.

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.5+
- Python 3.12+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)

> **Python setup:** Uninstall any existing Python versions before proceeding. Then install Python 3.12+ fresh from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Having multiple Python versions can cause conflicts with the MCP server.

### Sample project

For getting started quickly, feel free to use the starter project in `MCPGameProject`. This is a UE 5.5 Blank Starter Project with the `UnrealMCP.uplugin` already configured. 

1. **Prepare the project**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
2. **Build the project (including the plugin)**
   - Open solution (`.sln`)
   - Choose `Development Editor` as your target.
   - Build

### Plugin
Otherwise, if you want to use the plugin in your existing project:

1. **Copy the plugin to your project**
   - Copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP` to your project's Plugins folder

2. **Enable the plugin**
   - Edit > Plugins
   - Find "UnrealMCP" in Editor category
   - Enable the plugin
   - Restart editor when prompted

3. **Build the plugin**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
   - Open solution (`.sln)
   - Build with your target platform and output settings

### Python Server Setup

See [Python/README.md](Python/README.md) for detailed Python setup instructions, including:
- Setting up your Python environment
- Running the MCP server
- Using direct or server-based connections

### LLM configuration for NPC simulation

Create `Python/.env` with the provider and model you want the agent runtime to use. The file is ignored by git.

```dotenv
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini

# Optional Anthropic fallback
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

The OpenAI path uses the Responses HTTP API directly through `requests` instead of the OpenAI Python SDK. This avoids a Python 3.14 compatibility issue observed in the SDK/Pydantic stack while keeping the runtime behavior the same.

### Configuring your MCP Client

Use the following JSON for your mcp configuration based on your MCP client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path/to/the/folder/PYTHON>",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.


## Changes from Upstream

This fork adds the following on top of [chongdashu/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp):

### Character Interaction System
A full NPC character command system built on a new `UMCPCharacterComponent`:
- **Messaging** — send messages to characters and read their replies
- **Memory** — per-character key-value fact store
- **Status queries** — health, inventory, location, AI state, current action, nearby actors
- **Action commands** — move to location/actor, follow, stop, look at, pickup, drop, say, play animation, set AI state
- **Blueprint events** — `OnMessageReceived`, `OnSayRequested`, `OnAIStateChanged`, `OnInteractRequested`

See [Docs/character_system.md](Docs/character_system.md) for full details.

### Camera Capture System
A `CameraCaptureActor` and MCP tool that lets AI assistants take and analyze in-game screenshots during PIE:
- **Scene snapshots** — triggers a `SceneCaptureComponent2D` render and saves a PNG to the project folder
- **Timestamped filenames** — each capture is saved as `<ActorName>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>.png`, so no captures are overwritten
- **Auto-discovery** — if no actor name is passed, the first `CameraCaptureActor` in the level is used
- **Image analysis** — AI clients can read the saved image and describe or reason about the scene

### AI RPG Agent Simulation
A first-pass agentic NPC simulation layer driven by an LLM-controlled Agent Manager running inside the Python MCP server. See [`AI_RPG_Agent_Simulation_MASTER_PLAN.md`](AI_RPG_Agent_Simulation_MASTER_PLAN.md) for the complete design.
- **Agent Manager** — start/stop/pause an autonomous simulation loop from the CLI
- **Live agent binding** — active agents bind to named Unreal actors or spawn from configured Blueprint classes
- **Multi-tier agents** — Hero (full LLM), Simulated (event-driven LLM), and Lightweight (no LLM unless explicitly configured)
- **World-state driven** — agents observe Unreal structured data; screenshots used selectively
- **Validated action pipeline** — LLM decisions are schema-validated before any Unreal command executes
- **Camera-mounted NPC acceptance path** — Bartleby is wired to `BP_CameraNPC` with a `CameraCaptureActor` child mount

---

## 🎭 Character Interaction System

The plugin includes a full NPC character command system added on top of the base MCP tools.

### Quick setup per NPC
1. Add `UMCPCharacterComponent` to your NPC Blueprint
2. Assign an AI Controller (required for move/follow/stop)
3. Implement the Blueprint events you want: `OnMessageReceived`, `OnSayRequested`, `OnAIStateChanged`, `OnInteractRequested`

### Example
```python
# Send a message to an NPC
send_character_message("GuardNPC", "The player was spotted near the north gate")

# Command the NPC to walk somewhere
command_character_move_to("GuardNPC", location=[1000, 500, 0])

# Make the NPC pick up a weapon
command_character_pickup("GuardNPC", "Sword_01")

# Make the NPC say something (fires OnSayRequested in Blueprint)
command_character_say("GuardNPC", "Halt! Who goes there?")

# Read replies the NPC has queued in their outbox
get_character_messages("GuardNPC", source="outbox", clear=True)
```

See [Docs/character_system.md](Docs/character_system.md) for the full command reference, component property list, and setup checklist.

## 🤖 AI RPG Agent Simulation

> **Status: Prototype** — See [`AI_RPG_Agent_Simulation_MASTER_PLAN.md`](AI_RPG_Agent_Simulation_MASTER_PLAN.md) and [`still_todo.md`](still_todo.md) for the full design and current task list.

The simulation layer lets an LLM (Claude, OpenAI, or a local model) autonomously drive NPCs inside a live Unreal session via the MCP server.

### Architecture

```
Claude / OpenAI CLI
        │  MCP tool calls
        ▼
Python MCP Server  ─── Agent Manager + Simulation Harness
        │              ├─ AgentRegistry / MemoryStore
        │              ├─ LLMRouter (per-agent model selection)
        │              └─ ActionValidator (schema + allowlist)
        │  Unreal commands
        ▼
Unreal C++ MCP Plugin → Unreal Editor / PIE
```

### Key MCP tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `start_simulation` | Start the autonomous agent loop |
| `stop_simulation` | Stop the loop |
| `pause_simulation` / `resume_simulation` | Pause or resume without losing state |
| `get_simulation_status` | Live status of the running sim |
| `list_agents` / `inspect_agent` | Browse active agents |
| `set_agent_goal` | Override an agent's current goal |
| `force_agent_tick` | Manually pulse a single agent |
| `get_recent_events` | Tail the world event log |
| `reload_llm_environment` | Reload `Python/.env` and report masked LLM settings |

### Bartleby acceptance smoke test

With Unreal running in PIE and `unrealMCP` connected:

```txt
reload_llm_environment()
start_simulation(tick_seconds=10, active_agents=["bartleby"])
force_agent_tick("bartleby")
capture_camera_image()
get_recent_events(limit=10)
stop_simulation()
```

Expected current behavior: Bartleby binds to the `Bartleby` actor, the camera capture tool saves a PNG from the `CameraMount` child actor, and the LLM decision loop returns a validated action or a logged error. Generated captures and decision logs are ignored by git.

### Agent tiers

| Tier | Examples | LLM usage |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 — Hero | Gondolf, main villain, quest giver | Full memory + goal reasoning every tick |
| 2 — Simulated | Innkeeper, blacksmith, guard captain | LLM only when near player or interrupted |
| 3 — Lightweight | Villagers, animals, basic guards | Behavior Tree; LLM only on promotion |
